# DSL Lang
 By: Virat R. Ponugoti

## What is this?
This is a programming language designed to make programming autonomous routes **more readable** by non programmers. Shh, ChatGPT made half of this. (Vibe Coding)

## But Why?
I got bored.

## Language Features
Nothing. It can translate function notation weirdly into CPP. <br>
Use API to define functions. <br>
Use routine to make route. <br>
Use initial_cpp_code for headers and BS. <br>
Use block for cpp interop. (kind of) <br>
Comments are //

## TODO (That I won't Do)
- Make it an actual programming language
    - Add functions
    - Add variables
    - Add loops
    - Add if and else
- Add C++ interop
- Add function auto recognize.
